    <p>
      are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets. 
      Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.
      [3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven.
        resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.

 <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 1</strong>  
        Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
        <br> Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.   
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>  
        Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>  
        Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg.<br>
        Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>  
    Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes.<br>
    Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.
